We forgot the second closing `)` at the end of our input.
Remember, on each line for every open bracket, there needs to be a closing bracket.

### Extra challenge
ðŸ‘‰  What is the error?

We forgot the first opening `(` before `input`.
Remember, for casting to float or int, we need to enclose the thing to be casted into starting and closing brackets..

We also forgot to end the double quote `"` after `"Exactly!`
